This is something that can be easily plugged into various apps for various use cases. Customer support can be one of the use cases of the apps that might need this. Spam filtering module can filter if the content is a spam or not. This too can be used as a module by various apps to automate things. The third model can be used to identify different verbal instructions. The data used for this is obtained from the Speech Recognition challenge on Kaggle. This model can be used by apps that want to use verbal cues in order to control navigations in the app. For example, instructions like stop, on, off, etc can all be intelligently used by apps to enable navigation in the applications as one of the use cases."
